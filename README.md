<!--Pinocchio: a C++ library for efficient Rigid Multi-body Dynamics computations
===========
-->

**Pinocchio** instantiates the state-of-the-art Rigid Body Algorithms for poly-articulated systems based on revisited Roy Featherstone's algorithms.
Besides, **Pinocchio** provides the analytical derivatives of the main Rigid-Body Algorithms like the Recursive Newton-Euler Algorithm or the Articulated-Body Algorithm.

**Pinocchio** is first tailored for robotics applications, but it can be used in extra contexts (biomechanics, computer graphics, vision, etc.).
It is built upon Eigen for linear algebra and FCL for collision detection. **Pinocchio** comes with a Python interface for fast code prototyping, [directly accessible](https://github.com/conda-forge/pinocchio-feedstock#installing-pinocchio) through [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).

**Pinocchio** is now at the heart of various robotics software as [Crocoddyl](https://github.com/loco-3d/crocoddyl/tree/devel), an open-source and efficient Differential Dynamic Programming solver for robotics, the [Stack-of-Tasks](http://stack-of-tasks.github.io), an open-source and versatile hierarchical controller framework or the [Humanoid Path Planner](https://humanoid-path-planner.github.io/hpp-doc), an open-source software for Motion and Manipulation Planning.

If you want to learn more on **Pinocchio** internal behaviors and main features, we invite you to read the related [paper](https://hal-laas.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01866228).

If you want to directly dive into **Pinocchio**, only one single line is sufficient (assuming you have Conda):

<p align="center">
<strong> conda install pinocchio -c conda-forge </strong>
</p>

or via pip (currently only available on Linux):
<p align="center">
<strong> pip install pin </strong>
</p>

## Pinocchio main features

**Pinocchio** is fast:

   - C++ template library,
   - cache friendly,
   - automatic code generation support via [CppADCodeGen](https://github.com/joaoleal/CppADCodeGen).

**Pinocchio** is versatile, implementing basic and more advanced rigid body dynamics algorithms:

   - forward kinematics and its analytical derivatives,
   - forward/inverse dynamics and their analytical derivatives,
   - centroidal dynamics and its analytical derivatives,
   - support of multiple precision arithmetic via Boost.Multiprecision or any similar framework,
   - computations of kinematic and dynamic regressors for system identification and more,
   - and much more with the support of modern and open source Automatic Differentiation frameworks like [CppAD](https://github.com/coin-or/CppAD) or [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/).

**Pinocchio** is flexible:

   - header only,
   - C++ 98/03/11/14/17/20 compliant.

**Pinocchio** is extensible.
**Pinocchio** is multi-thread friendly.
**Pinocchio** is reliable and extensively tested (unit-tests, simulations and real world robotics applications).
**Pinocchio** is supported and tested on Windows, Mac OS X, Unix and Linux ([see build status here](http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/rbulk/robotpkg/math/pinocchio/index.html)).

## Pinocchio continuous integrations

**Pinocchio** is constantly tested for several platforms and distributions, as reported below:

## Performances

**Pinocchio** exploits at best the sparsity induced by the kinematic tree of robotics systems. Thanks to modern programming language paradigms, **Pinocchio** is able to unroll most of the computations directly at compile time, allowing to achieve impressive performances for a large range of robots, as illustrated by the plot below, obtained on a standard laptop equipped with an Intel Core i7 CPU @ 2.4 GHz.

</p>

For other benchmarks, and mainly the capacity of Pinocchio to exploit at best your CPU capacities using advanced code generation techniques, we refer to the technical [paper](https://hal-laas.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01866228).
In addition, the introspection done [here](https://github.com/rbd-benchmarks/rbd-benchmarks) may also help you to understand and compare the performances of the modern rigid body dynamics librairies.

## Ongoing developments

If you want to follow the current developments, you can directly refer to the [devel branch](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/tree/devel).
The [master branch](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/tree/master/) only contains latest release. Any new Pull Request should then be submitted on the [devel branch](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/tree/devel/).

## Installation

**Pinocchio** can be easily installed on various Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.) and Unix distributions (Mac OS X, BSD, etc.). Please refer to the [installation procedure](http://stack-of-tasks.github.io/pinocchio/download.html).

If you only need the Python bindings of Pinocchio, you may prefer to install it through [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/). Please follow the procedure described [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/pinocchio-feedstock#installing-pinocchio).

**Pinocchio** is also deployed on ROS, you may follow its deployment status on [Melodic](https://index.ros.org/r/pinocchio/#melodic) or [Kinetic](https://index.ros.org/r/pinocchio/#kinetic).
