<!--Pinocchio: a C++ library for efficient Rigid Multi-body Dynamics computations
===========
-->

**Pinocchio** instantiates the state-of-the-art Rigid Body Algorithms for poly-articulated systems based on revisited Roy Featherstone's algorithms.
Besides, **Pinocchio** provides the analytical derivatives of the main Rigid-Body Algorithms like the Recursive Newton-Euler Algorithm or the Articulated-Body Algorithm.

**Pinocchio** was first tailored for robotics applications, but it can be used in other contexts (biomechanics, computer graphics, vision, etc.).
It is built upon Eigen for linear algebra and FCL for collision detection. **Pinocchio** comes with a Python interface for fast code prototyping, [directly accessible](https://github.com/conda-forge/pinocchio-feedstock#installing-pinocchio) through [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).

**Pinocchio** is now at the heart of various robotics software as [Crocoddyl](https://github.com/loco-3d/crocoddyl/tree/devel), an open-source and efficient Differential Dynamic Programming solver for robotics, the [Stack-of-Tasks](http://stack-of-tasks.github.io), an open-source and versatile hierarchical controller framework or the [Humanoid Path Planner](https://humanoid-path-planner.github.io/hpp-doc), open-source software for Motion and Manipulation Planning.

If you want to learn more about **Pinocchio** internal behaviors and main features, we invite you to read the related [paper](https://hal-laas.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01866228) and the online [documentation](https://gepettoweb.laas.fr/doc/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/master/doxygen-html/).

If you want to dive into **Pinocchio** directly, only one single line is sufficient (assuming you have Conda):

<p align="center">
<strong> conda install pinocchio -c conda-forge </strong>
</p>

or via pip (currently only available on Linux):
<p align="center">
<strong> pip install pin </strong>
</p>

## Introducing Pinocchio 3
**Pinocchio3** is released for development under the branch [pinocchio3-preview](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/tree/pinocchio3-preview) on the main github repository.
With **Pinocchio3**, multiple new features are introduced in **Pinocchio**, such as:
  - Sparse Solution of Constrained Dynamics (Published in Robotics: Science and Systems 2021)
  - Constrained Dynamics Derivatives (In pre-publishing stages)
  - Constraint Models for handling loop constraints.
  - Full casadi support in python and C++
  - Increased support of CppAD and CppADCodeGen
  - New SDF parser.
  - and much more...

**Pinocchio** developers are highly encouraged to check out the new features. However, please keep in mind that this remains a **development** branch, and thus the API between 2.9.x and 2.9.{x+1} could change without backward compatibility.

The new constrained dynamics algorithm can be cited by the following publication:

## Pinocchio main features

**Pinocchio** is fast:

   - C++ template library,
   - cache friendly,
   - automatic code generation support is available via [CppADCodeGen](https://github.com/joaoleal/CppADCodeGen).

**Pinocchio** is versatile, implementing basic and more advanced rigid body dynamics algorithms:

   - forward kinematics and its analytical derivatives,
   - forward/inverse dynamics and their analytical derivatives,
   - centroidal dynamics and its analytical derivatives,
   - support multiple precision arithmetic via Boost.Multiprecision or any similar framework,
   - computations of kinematic and dynamic regressors for system identification and more,
   - and much more with the support of modern and open-source Automatic Differentiation frameworks like [CppAD](https://github.com/coin-or/CppAD) or [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/).

**Pinocchio** is flexible:

   - header only,
   - C++ 98/03/11/14/17/20 compliant.

**Pinocchio** is extensible.
**Pinocchio** is multi-thread friendly.
**Pinocchio** is reliable and extensively tested (unit-tests, simulations, and real-world robotics applications).
**Pinocchio** is supported and tested on Windows, Mac OS X, Unix, and Linux ([see build status here](http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/rbulk/robotpkg/math/pinocchio/index.html)).

## Documentation

The online **Pinocchio** documentation of the last release is available [here](https://gepettoweb.laas.fr/doc/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/master/doxygen-html/). A cheat sheet pdf with the main functions and algorithms can be found [here](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/blob/master/doc/pinocchio_cheat_sheet.pdf).

## Examples

We provide some basic examples of using **Pinocchio** in Python in the [examples](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/tree/master/examples) directory.
Additional examples introducing **Pinocchio** are also available in the [documentation](https://gepettoweb.laas.fr/doc/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/master/doxygen-html/md_doc_d-practical-exercises_intro.html).

## Tutorials

**Pinocchio** comes with a large bunch of tutorials aiming at introducing the basic tools for robot control.
Tutorial and training documents are listed [here](https://gepettoweb.laas.fr/doc/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/master/doxygen-html/index.html#OverviewConclu).
You can also consider the interactive Jupyter notebook [set of tutorials](https://github.com/ymontmarin/_tps_robotique) developed by [Nicolas Mansard](https://gepettoweb.laas.fr/index.php/Members/NicolasMansard) and [Yann de Mont-Marin](https://github.com/ymontmarin).

## Performances

**Pinocchio** exploits, at best, the sparsity induced by the kinematic tree of robotics systems. Thanks to modern programming language paradigms, **Pinocchio** can unroll most of the computations directly at compile time, allowing to achieve impressive performances for a large range of robots, as illustrated by the plot below, obtained on a standard laptop equipped with an Intel Core i7 CPU @ 2.4 GHz.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/master/doc/images/pinocchio-performances.png" width="600" alt="Pinocchio Logo" align="center"/>
</p>

For other benchmarks, and mainly the capacity of Pinocchio to exploit, at best, your CPU capacities using advanced code generation techniques, we refer to the technical [paper](https://hal-laas.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01866228).
In addition, the [introspection](https://github.com/rbd-benchmarks/rbd-benchmarks) may also help you to understand and compare the performances of the modern rigid body dynamics libraries.

## Ongoing developments

If you want to follow the current developments, you can directly refer to the [devel branch](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/tree/devel).
The [master branch](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/tree/master/) only contains the latest release. Any new Pull Request should then be submitted on the [devel branch](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/tree/devel/).

## Installation

**Pinocchio** can be easily installed on various Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.) and Unix distributions (Mac OS X, BSD, etc.). Please refer to the [installation procedure](http://stack-of-tasks.github.io/pinocchio/download.html).

If you only need the Python bindings of Pinocchio, you may prefer to install it through [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/). Please follow the procedure described [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/pinocchio-feedstock#installing-pinocchio).

### ROS

**Pinocchio** is also deployed on ROS.
You may follow its deployment status below.

If you're interested in using Pinocchio on systems and/or with packages that integrate with the ROS ecosystem, we recommend the installation of Pinocchio via the binaries distributed via the ROS PPA.
Here, you can install Pinocchio using:

```
sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-pinocchio
```

This installs Pinocchio with HPP-FCL support and with Python bindings.
You can then use Pinocchio in your ROS packages by:

* Depending on Pinocchio in your `package.xml` config (`<depend>pinocchio</depend>`)
* Including Pinocchio via CMake (`find_package(pinocchio REQUIRED)`) and linking against Pinocchio (`target_link_libraries(my_library pinocchio::pinocchio)`)

We include support and hooks to discover the package for both ROS 1 and ROS 2.
Examples can be found at the following repositories:
* [ROS 1 example](https://github.com/wxmerkt/pinocchio_ros_example)
* [ROS 2 example](https://github.com/sea-bass/pinocchio_ros_cpp_example)

Please note that we always advise including the `pinocchio/fwd.hpp` header as the first include to avoid compilation errors from differing Boost-variant sizes.
