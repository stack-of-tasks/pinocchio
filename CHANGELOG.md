## [1.2.1] - 2016-10-17

### Summary

This release is a minor patch of the previous release 1.2.0.

This release is directly accessible as a Debian package. Please see https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/wiki/installation for further details.

### New
- The Python bindings are aligned and free of unnecessary allocations
- Add documentation option which allows to not install the documentation
- Introduces container::aligned_vector to automatically create an std::vector with specific aligned allocator

### API modifications
- Remove JointDense.
- Remove JointGeneric

### Fixes

## [1.2.0] - 2016-09-29

### Summary

The main modifications concern the update of the code to comply with the Humanoid Path Planner (HPP).

This release is directly accessible as a Debian package. Please see https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio/wiki/installation for further details.

### New Features
- Add Joint{Model,Data} classes based on Joint{Model,Data}Base and Joint{Model,Data}Variant. Those classes call directly the visitors and make Variant accessible throw methods
- Add partial Joint{Model,Data}Composite. They allow a stack of joints without adding any Inertia.
- Increase Frame class. Frames can be of several types (BODY, JOINT, SENSOR, etc) and reflect the robot tree as it appears in the URDF conventions. Frames have two attributes: parent which the direct Joint parent in the Joint tree, previousFrame which correspond to the parent Frame in the tree of Frames).
- Adding Python parser which is able to read models written in Python.
- Add algo checker to check the validity of a model.
- Improve documentation.

### API modifications
- Model has some methods deprecated. The default name has been removed.
- The Geometry classes have been updated and several methods have been set to deprecated. They now use Frames as parent instead of Joint directly: a Geometry is now supported by a BODY.
- Add active collision pair flags in GeomData which define the active collision pairs.
- Unify naming conventions (nframes, njoints, etc).

### Fixes
- The UDRF parser can now deal with more complex topologies. It properly handles the stack of geometries for each BODY.
- Improve packaging mainly around the Python part.

- Geometry primitives can now be handled (and added to the Pinocchio GeometryModel) when encountered in an urdf file
- Implemented simple srdf parsing for GeometryData : parse the desactivated collision pairs

- Added algorithms working with vectors of configuration or velocity(either on a JointModel or on a Model, iterating through all the kinematic tree)
  - One can integrate a configuration at a constant velocity during a unit time
  - One can differentiate two configurations (i.e compute the velocity that must be integrated during a unit time to go from first configuration to the other )
  - One can interpolate between two configurations
  - One cancompute the distance between two configurations ( such as dist = norm ( difference) )
  - One can shoot a configuration uniformly sampled between specified limits
- Added Impulse Dynamic Algorithm
- Completed the list of method to access or call Joint's data or method when joint are stored in a variant.
- Added JointAccessor that is a general joint encapsulating a JointVariant ( abstracting the use of visitors for the user).

- The Geometry objects stored in GeometryModel are now splitted in two types : visual and collision

### Minor

### Summary

### New Features
- Spatial classes now follow the CRTP Design Pattern, for performance reasons.
- JointModels are now exposed in Python. This feature enables one to load a URDF model with a precise root joint and to create his/her own model.
- Python models can now be created by hand ( ex: buildEmptyModel() + calls to addBody() )
- Added utility tools to check an urdf model ( same as check_urdf but dislpay the Pinocchio model created from urdf parsing)
- Add unaligned prismatic joint
- Add geometry through Flexible Collision Library ([hpp-fcl](https://github.com/humanoid-path-planner/hpp-fcl))
  - Add dedicated structs  to handle geometry. GeometryModel (list of geometry objects and its relation wrt kinematic model) and GeometryData
  - When parsing urdf, meshes can be read from collada files and handled in Pinocchio
  - Created parser that handles geometry and exposed it in python
  - Add algorithms to update the geometry kinematics, to compute the distances for pairs of collision or if they are colliding or not.
- Added algorithms to compute the kinetic energy, the potential energy and exposed it in python
- The complete documentation is in progress

### API modifications
