    /* This handler is designed first for holding the C++ Model object, then
     * generalized for the C++ Data object. It might be used as well for
     * handling other object whose ownership is shared between python and C++.
     *
     * There might be several way of building and owning a model object:
     *   - build from C++ (as static or dynamic, wathever), and owned by
     * C++. In that case, use a ModelHandler with no ownership ModelHandler(
     * Model*,false).
     *   - build from C++ but owned by python. Python would be in charge of
     * destroying it when it is done. In that case, use
     * ModelHandler(Model*,true). Take care not to destroy the object by
     * yourself, otherwise there might have access to deallocated memory and
     * double destruction.
     *   - build and managed by shared_ptr. It is the best way, in the sense
     * that the object is manage both by C++ and python. It will be released
     * only when both are done with it.  In that case, simply give Python the
     * shared_ptr ModelHandler( shared_ptr<Model> ).
     * 
     * It is not possible to construct a Model from python, because of Eigen
     * memory alignement.  The python visitor does not define any
     * constructor. Instead, some static makers (function allocating memory and
     * returning a pointer Model *) are implemented.  When Python is making
     * such a Model, it is stored in a shared_ptr and can be access directly
     * from C++. By default, when passing a Model to python, it is kept as a
     * raw pointer. Access is then done from python to the C++ memory without
     * any guarantee. If you want to enforce memory access, prefer transmitting
     * a shared_ptr to python.
