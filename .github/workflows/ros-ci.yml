      # The following is a work-around for ROS tooling in conjunction with jrl-cmakemodules:
      #  - catkin_make_isolated has issues with Industrial-CI right now
      #  - colcon cannot find example-robot-data's python bindings due to ROS1 workspace integration hooks
      #  - catkin_tools correctly finds example-robot-data in the upstream_ws, but does not execute the 'run_tests' target
      #    as catkin-tools performs tests as '--catkin-make-args' instead of '--make-args' as colcon and catkin_make_isolated
      # The work-around is thus to use catkin_tools for building and sourcing, and to manually specify execution of the test
      # target after completion of the regular test target. The output of this step does affect the output of the CI process.
      # Note, this does not affect projects that do not have pure CMake projects in their upstream_ws.
